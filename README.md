# First-Person 3D Garden

This repository contains the web-based MVP for a tranquil first-person gardening sandbox. The project uses [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering, [cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es) for physics, [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and build tooling.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be served at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs a production-ready bundle to `dist/`.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Currently no automated tests are defined.

Refer to `Product_Spec.md` for detailed design and gameplay information.
